# Pokemon Gen3 Code Generator (local installer)

These scripts allow running the [Code Generator](https://e-sh4rk.github.io/CodeGenerator/)
locally, adapted for an offline use.

Dependencies:
- Python 3
- requests (`pip3 install requests`)

Run `python3 ./download.py` to download the code generator locally. It should create a directory `app`.

Then, you can run `python3 ./run.py` to use the code generator locally, without needing an Internet connection.
